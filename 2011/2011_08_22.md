# I Love Waking Up To Awesome Pull Requests

## Hacking

Woke up to an [awesome](https://github.com/leto/math--gsl/pull/22) pull request for Math::GSL. Social coding for the win.

## Writing

Finally got a first draft of a CASH Music blog post up. Why did that take so long?

## Gardening

Trained the Kudzu onto the roof in the backyard. This should be interesting.
