## Shaving Yaks Like A Rural Farm Barber

# Bugs Noticed

 * Empty links such as ```<a href="foo"></a>``` make WWW::Mechanize throw annoying warnings
 * Math::GSL can't deal with arrays of doubles
 * The docs for gsl_ran_dirichlet at http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/manual/html_node/The-Dirichlet-Distribution.html seem wrong. It says "This function returns an array of K random variates ..." but the documented function signature returns void.

# Frustrating

 * Storable.pm can't serialize filehandles
 * Mozilla Developer Network emails passwords in plaintext.

# Awesome

 * Github allows repos to begin with a dot. These guys rock.
