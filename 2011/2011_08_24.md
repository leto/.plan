# Back to Work

Starting hacking on [Mimosa](http://gmod.github.com/mimosa) again, currently
trying to integrate [spin.js](http://fgnass.github.com/spin.js/) to make people
less anxious when waiting.

## Bugs

SQL::Translator has a bug in which it can't parse recent dumps of MySQL databases, such as
the CASH Music schema.


    (skai)(~/git/DIY master )$ sqlt -f MySQL -t SQLite ./framework/php/settings/sql/cashmusic_db.sql
        ERROR (line 5): Invalid statement: Was expecting comment, or use, or
                        set, or drop, or create, or alter, or insert, or
                                        delimiter, or empty statement
    Error: translate: Error with parser 'SQL::Translator::Parser::MySQL':  no results at /home/leto/git/cxgn/local-lib/bin/sqlt line 353.

The issue seems that it doesn't understand the "bit" column type. Converting it to a BOOL gets rid of the issue.
