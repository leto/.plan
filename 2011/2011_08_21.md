# Hacking and Gardening, Continued

## Hacking

Still working on https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=673188 . Learning more and more about the innards
of Spidermonkey. Also learnign about Yarr! (Yet Another Regex Runtime), which was [originally](http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/42481) written
by Apple as part of Webkit, but was [recently integrated into Spidermonkey](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=564953) by Chris Leary.

## Gardening

Planted two Large Leaf Italian Basil plants in the front garden.
