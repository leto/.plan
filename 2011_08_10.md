## ENOCOFFEE && EMISSINGCAT

The cat was hiding under the bushes in the front of the house. I looked there originally, but not hard enough.

I need an lack of coffee Early Warning System. Running out of coffee *should never happen*.

# Bugs

 * Mimosa has a tiny little UI bug where the "advanced" div gets unhidden with
 a checkbox, but when you use the browser back button, the state gets inverted,
 so you have to "uncheck" it to see the advanced div. Annoying.
