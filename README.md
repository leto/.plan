## I love it when a .plan comes together

This is a collection of my .plan files, where I capture mental debris and other
random junk that is too small and disorganized to put anywhere else.

They are tangentially inspired by [John Carmack's .plan archive](http://www.team5150.com/~andrew/carmack/plan.html).

Each .plan has some kind of possibly witty "title for the day", along with a few sections that I make up as I go along.

My .plan files are in Markdown, because this ain't the 90's anymore.
